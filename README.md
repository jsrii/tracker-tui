# tracker-tui

The tui version of https://trackerhub.cx/, currently a made-in-progress, made with charm's tools, no content is owned, managed, or hosted by tracker-tui. Also this is my first project written in Go so please don't flame me if my code looks like a pile of crap (probably already does) 🙏🙏🙏🙏, I'm 10000000000000000000% going to clean this code up down the road for sure
